## Contributing

To contribute to the lorebook, please either edit or add your card to the [trello](https://trello.com/b/FcGV0TRc/progress-of-the-mge-lorebook) to avoid having more than one person working on the same entry at one time. Please indicate who is working on that entry.

An entry you want to add to the lorebook must be related to the Monster Girl Encyclopedia. It can be of a concept, a race, a subrace, an item or anything else related to MGE. Another type of entry we might need is some entries for stuff like wings or tails, to explain where they are usually attached. If you can, please try to split the entries into core concepts so it's easier to build from them (For example, the lesser succubus entry will be build upon the succubus one, making sure that any keys that trigger it will also trigger the main one too.)

As a general structure for writing the entry, please try to keep your entries about 100 tokens long at a maximum.
Also, try to order the content in this way:

1. Explaining what type of entry it is.
2. Explaining what they do.
3. Explaining what they look like.

To contribute, download the scenario, import it in Novel AI, then export it back when edited and merge its content with the one in this repository, creating a merge request. At the same time, if it's your first merge request, you can add yourself as a contributor on this file.
